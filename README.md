# gameful_user_types_crowdsourcing

Repository containing the dataset employed for the statistical analysis presented in the paper "Rather Multifaceted than Disruptors: Exploring Gamification User Types of Crowdworkers." This repository is provisional for review purposes. Once the paper is approved for publication, the dataset will be published in a research dataset database.

## Dataset

The dataset corresponds to the demographic data, HEXAD user type scores, and performance score (mean_score) for 481 crowdworkers who participated in a user study conducted via Microworkers and Amazon MTurk. The dataset is presented in a CSV file.

The dataset only includes the data of crowdworkers who pass all the reliability checks described in the paper.
